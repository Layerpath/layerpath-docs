# Capture Help Guide

## What are the screen capture options?
You can capture the current browser tab. Select full screen to record across multiple tabs.

> **Note:** We do not offer multi-window recording.

## Can I pause/resume my recording?
Yes, you can pause the recording at any time by clicking on the Layerpath Chrome extension icon. A menu will appear with control options â€” simply click **Pause** to temporarily stop the recording. When you're ready to continue, reopen the extension and select **Resume** to pick up right where you left off.

## Can I choose to cancel the recording?
Yes, you can cancel the recording at any time by clicking the **Cancel** button in the Chrome plugin. This will immediately stop and discard the current recording.
