# Analytics & Lead Generation

LayerPath provides powerful analytics and lead generation tools to help you measure the impact of your demos, guides, and videos, and to capture valuable user information.

## What You Can Track

- **Views**: See how many people have viewed your content.
- **Engagement**: Track how users interact with your demos, guides, and videos (clicks, completions, drop-offs).
- **Completion Rates**: Measure how many users finish your tours or guides.
- **Heatmaps**: Visualize where users click and interact most.
- **Lead Capture**: Collect user information (name, email, company, etc.) via embedded forms.
- **Conversion Tracking**: Monitor how many users take desired actions (sign up, request a demo, etc.).

## How to Use Analytics

1. **Open your project** in the LayerPath dashboard.
2. Go to the **Analytics** tab for detailed metrics.
3. Filter data by date range, content type, or user segment.
4. Export analytics data for further analysis (CSV, integrations).

## Lead Generation Features

- **Embedded Forms**: Add forms to your demos and guides to capture leads directly.
- **CRM Integrations**: Sync captured leads with Salesforce, HubSpot, and other CRMs.
- **Automated Follow-ups**: Trigger emails or notifications based on user actions.

## Best Practices

- Place lead capture forms at key points in your content (e.g., before completion or after a key feature is shown).
- Use analytics to identify drop-off points and optimize your content flow.
- Regularly export and review analytics to inform product and marketing decisions.

## Privacy & Compliance

- All analytics and lead data are stored securely and comply with GDPR and other privacy regulations.
- Users can opt out of tracking or data collection as required.
