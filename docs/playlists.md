# Playlists and Content Organization

Playlists in LayerPath offer a powerful way to organize and share your projects, making it easier for users to learn complex topics or follow specific workflows. Think of playlists as curated learning paths that guide users through a structured educational journey.

## What are Playlists?

Playlists are collections of LayerPath projects grouped together based on a common theme or learning objective. You can create playlists containing projects in different formats (Tours, Guides, Videos) to provide a well-rounded learning experience.

### Project Format Overview

Before diving into playlists, let's review the different project formats you can include:

- **Tours**: Interactive format where users navigate through slides or layers using clicks or keyboard arrows, with each step presented as captured images
- **Guides**: Step-by-step documentation format showcasing images and videos from recordings, with detailed explanations for each step
- **Videos**: Complete screen recordings with added text animations, zoom, and rotate effects, resulting in polished and visually appealing video presentations

## Creating Playlists and Collections

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Access Playlists**: Navigate to the "Playlists" section within LayerPath
2. **Create a Playlist**: Click the "Create Playlist" button and provide a descriptive name for your playlist
3. **Add Collections**: Within the playlist, click "Add Collection" to create a sub-category for grouping related projects. Give each collection a clear and concise title
4. **Adding Projects to Collections**: When saving a project, select the relevant collection(s) within the playlist to add it to the appropriate group

### Naming Best Practices

- **Playlists**: Use broad, thematic names (e.g., "CRM Onboarding", "Advanced Features", "Troubleshooting")
- **Collections**: Use specific, action-oriented names (e.g., "Getting Started", "User Management", "Reporting Dashboard")

## Example: CRM Onboarding Playlist

Let's walk through creating a comprehensive onboarding playlist for a CRM application:

### Playlist Structure

```
📁 CRM Onboarding Playlist
├── 🗂️ Getting Started Collection
│   ├── Welcome Tour (Interactive Tour)
│   ├── Account Setup Guide (Step-by-step Guide)
│   └── Dashboard Overview (Video)
├── 🗂️ Contact Management Collection
│   ├── Adding Contacts (Guide)
│   ├── Contact Organization (Tour)
│   └── Contact Import Process (Video)
└── 🗂️ Sales Pipeline Collection
    ├── Pipeline Setup (Guide)
    ├── Deal Management (Tour)
    └── Reporting Features (Video)
```

### Learning Path Benefits

This structured approach helps new users:

1. **Start with basics**: Welcome and setup essentials
2. **Build core skills**: Contact management fundamentals
3. **Master advanced features**: Sales pipeline and reporting

## Sharing Playlists

### Distribution Methods

Once you've created your playlist with relevant collections and projects, you can share it with:

- **Specific users** within your organization
- **Teams** for collaborative learning

## Benefits of Using Playlists

### 1. Structured Learning
