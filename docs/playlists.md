# Playlists

LayerPath allows you to create various instructional content formats like interactive Tours, step-by-step Guides, and comprehensive Videos. Playlists offer a powerful way to organize and share these projects, making it easier for users to learn complex topics or follow specific workflows.

You might already be familiar with the different project formats in LayerPath. Here's a brief overview:

- **Tours**: Interactive format where users navigate through slides or layers using clicks or keyboard arrows, with each step presented as captured images.
- **Guides**: Step-by-step documentation format showcasing images and videos from the recording, with detailed explanations for each step.
- **Videos**: Complete screen recordings with added text animations, zoom, and rotate effects, resulting in polished and visually appealing video presentations.

## What are Playlists?

Playlists are collections of LayerPath projects grouped together based on a common theme or learning objective. You can create playlists containing projects in different formats (Tours, Guides, Videos) to provide a well-rounded learning experience.

## Creating Playlists and Collections

1. **Access Playlists**: Navigate to the "Playlists" section within LayerPath.
2. **Create a Playlist**: Click the "Create Playlist" button and provide a descriptive name for your playlist.
3. **Add Collections**: Within the playlist, click "Add Collection" to create a sub-category for grouping related projects. Give each collection a clear and concise title.
4. **Adding Projects to Collections**: Once you have collections, navigate to your existing projects or create new ones. When saving a project, select the relevant collection(s) within the playlist to add it to the appropriate group.

## Example: Onboarding Playlist

Scenario: You want to create a playlist explaining the features and functionalities within your CRM application to onboard new users.

This type of playlist could include:

- Tours showing key interface elements
- Guides explaining step-by-step workflows
- Videos demonstrating complete processes

## Sharing Playlists

Once you've created your playlist with relevant collections and projects, you can share it with specific users or teams within LayerPath. This provides them with a structured learning path to understand the sales pipeline management process effectively.

## Benefits of Playlists

**1. Structured Learning**: Playlists allow you to organize multiple guides into a cohesive learning path, ideal for onboarding and training.

**2. Improved Accessibility**: With all resources grouped in one place, users can easily find and revisit content as needed.

**3. Enhanced Engagement**: Playlists create a step-by-step journey, encouraging users to complete each part and gain full understanding.

**4. Customization**: Tailor Playlists to different audiences, offering relevant guides for specific roles, experience levels, or topics.

**5. Time Efficiency**: By automating learning sequences, Playlists reduce repetitive explanations and streamline support efforts.
